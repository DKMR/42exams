# 42exams
A collection of exercises used during the 42 Piscine exams (English only).

## Please read me!
This repo contains known exercises that are used during weekly exams in C through the 42 Piscine process.

There are 6 difficulty levels, from level 0 (easiest) to level 5 (hardest). Each exam is a random mix of several of these exercises combined.

### What's been modified?
Subject files with languages other than English have been removed, file names have been renamed from *subject.en.txt* to *subject.txt*. Removed extra examples where the contents match the *subject.txt* file.

### Where are the solutions?
This repo is meant to be used as a clean slate for practice, it does not contain solutions or any additional files other than the bare minimum (subject + provided headers).

## Recommendations
You can download the official [Norminette](https://github.com/42School/norminette) to check your formatting. **Keep in mind the exams are NOT being validated based on formatting**, but it's still a good habit to pick up the required formatting style.

## Final words
